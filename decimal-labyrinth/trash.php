The Doors is a multimedia installation exploring psychedelia, drug use, and artificial intelligence. A sequel to Contra-Internet: Jubilee 2033—a film that follows author Ayn Rand on an acid trip, in which she bears witness to a dystopian future of the internet —The Doors is the first installment in a trilogy of queer science fiction works that takes on the fantasies, beliefs, and Californian histories that influence Silicon Valley and the tech industry today.The Doors looks closely at Silicon Valley’s connections to Californian counter-culture from the 1960s. Set within a mystical artificial garden, The Doors features a 7.1 surround sound design and six channels of video comprised of computer graphics sequences and psychedelic machine learning-generated imagery related to a new wave of drug use interested in “nootropics.” In contrast to a “turn on, tune in, drop out” ethos, taking nootropics has gained popularity in the tech industry as “smart drugs” designed to unlock the mind to labor harder and faster. Nootropics include commercially available “stacks” and microdoses of LSD and psilocybin mushrooms. The Doors envisions a psychedelic trip on nootropics, alluding to a constellation of Californian drug references including Aldous Huxley’s writing on LSD and the 1960s rock band of the same name fronted by Jim Morrison, nicknamed “the Lizard King.” The installation consists of spoken word poetry generated by artificial intelligence, trained on corporate nootropics literature and Morrison’s writing and voice. As poems are recited, CGI lizards modeled on the prehistoric Barbaturex morrisoni (named after Morrison) roam across a hexagonal formation of black mirror screens, a recasting of the doors of perception. The garden in The Doors is designed as a Metatron’s Cube—a symbol of sacred geometry used in nootropics branding and presented as an artificial grass sigil. The garden collapses geographies and includes plants and soundscapes from Myanmar, Hawaii, San Francisco Bay Area, Mojave Desert, and an imagined plastic garden. A neon greenwall looms over and illuminates the artificial flora, transforming a neural network diagram into an occult symbol. At its base resides a black sand alter with a lizard watering dish and heated rock. In the center, a drug menagerie stands, containing 65 popular nootropics, such as Neurohacker Collective’s Eternus stack, Infowars’ Brain Force Plus capsules, and 1P-LSD tabs. The Doors also features AI-driven video, trained on image datasets of psychedelic rock posters, LSD blotter art, brains, glass architecture, sacred geometry, broken glass, and lizard skin, and an AI soundtrack generated from binaural beats, crystal bowl sound baths, ASMR keyboard typing, and music by The Doors. The machine learning imagery, which is halted before it coheres into recognizable patterns, echoes the saturated, colorful imagery associated with psychedelia. Evoking a 1960s liquid light show, The Doors proposes AI as generative of a new psychedelic experience for the nootropics age, provoking hallucinations of how to see and control the future, optimize the brain for labor, and live forever.

siXren (verbum medicinae) project is inspired by models of ancient healing rhetorics, and their role in the upcoming age of posthumanity. The work explores the psychoacoustic and neurobiological effects of ancient verbal and sound formulas used in healing ceremonies, and abstracts and reapplies them into the matrix of contemporary sounds. Sonically and visually, we enter the liminal space between Earths rhythm and noise music, between digital and animate, pre-modern and hyper-modern. Ancient linguistic / sound patterns were considered as healing transformative and medicinal agents, and as the missing link between man and nature. Practices such as ancient Greek rhetorics, word magic, ritual poetry, as well as contemporary cognitive science and wellbeing methods, utilize the primordial power of utterance, rhythm, and sound to affect our animal senses, and consequently our body biology, brain chemistry, sensory and cognitive clarity. Ancient knowledge of verbal formulas serves to establish a new relationship with nature in the coming era of posthumanity, and informs the current sonic imaginary in our techno-ecology with poetic and healing sensibility. siXren (verbum medicinae) is made in collaboration with beepblip (sound) and Brina Vidic (visual and costume design), curated by Miha Colner, video DOP Rajko Bizjak.
'The Grief Portal' is a somatic movement video that you can do in your own living room and will bring you back to your own body, allowing you to rebuild from 'the compost of grief’. In their own words: “In this moment, it is clear that we have a lot to grieve. We are facing unprecedented social, environmental and political challenges on a global scale. Against the backdrop of Covid-19 individual grief of death and the loss of loved ones, historical grief of colonisation, migration and displacement, environmental grief over the harm and changes taking place in our home world are laid bare for all to see.Something needs to change. We must grieve these systems and allow them to compost, so we can grow more beautiful futures from the fertile soil of our loss.” Camılle Barton So how about a healing ritual conducted by the tender words and movement of Camille to soothe you back into life? See below how to experience the commission (Camille suggests playing the film either with headphones or on good speakers so you can enjoy the bass frequencies in the music!). In case you missed any of the past weekends' events, keep an eye out on our website as we will release all footage in November.

Refusing to comply with systems of mass consumption, Juliette Lizotte stopped going to the supermarket. She questions the food industry, as well as our individual responsibility for how we produce and consume. Changing the rules of her game, Juliette now obtains food directly at its source. Like a monk she commits herself to her new habits. Liberated from fictitious needs, and inspired by the natural food she eats and her taste for ‘Nightcore’, Juliette dreams of another world. One in which self-sufficiency is the new salvation, a privileged state to deal with guilt and rethink our needs on the path to asceticism. A Triptych Fantasy on Local Food invites you on a singular audiovisual trip through Juliette's hopes and dreams, taking pop culture to the extreme: high pitch, high bpm and high amateurism. Each chapter of this journey gives an odd teenage feeling of a new-found hope in a world gone terribly wrong, making you want to join the movement or run away as fast as you can.

The Museum is pleased to present the North American premiere of the video installation Liminals by Jeremy Shaw; a Vancouver artist who lives and works in Berlin. This immersive, multi-sensory experience is made possible for our visitors thanks to a generous loan from the Canadian collector Bruce Bailey. A rich work, Liminals at first appears to be a black and white 16 mm documentary shot sometime in the 1970s. But we are quickly informed by a BBC-like narrator of a story set three generations from now, when humanity is on the verge of extinction. The video follows eight subjects who are attempting to escape this fate and save humanity through a fantastic combination of Machine DNA brain augmentations and the engagement in long-abandoned spiritual rituals. Through this behaviour, they believe it will be possible to access a space in between the physical and the virtual – The Liminal – where humans can move towards a higher stage of evolution. As the subjects engage in a series of increasingly cathartic actions, from Kundalini to headbanging, the video evolves from its vérité aesthetic to something caught in between a ritual documentary, music video and utopian science fiction film. At the dramatic climax, an unexpected shift from black and white to psychedelic technicolour occurs, and we witness the dancers transform from analogue to digital, effectively accessing and becoming The Liminal.
