    <br />/// CHANT ///
    <br />////////////////////
    <br />Ongoing VAM chant.
    <br />​
    <br />(On the backgrund of dark ambient noise in Earth's frequency, bird screams and calls, nature sounds, mixing human and animal language in a more-than-human sonic ambiance.)

    <br />//// NARRATION & LECTURE ////
    <br />///////////////////////////////
    <br />​
    <br />(The narration uses insights from cognitive/neuro science and outlines the way language, sound and words affect our biology. The future sees further morphological freedom of the human, when human biology becomes subject to constant change. The knowledge of ancient pharmacological and medicinal use of language, becomes imperative for a new understanding of the human being as part of larger relational consciousness.)
    <br />​
    <br />
    <br />Using the power of words, chants or sound frequencies, is the only way to become optimized human in the informational age.
    <br />
    <br />Words affect matter.
    <br />A word produces a feeling, starting a biochemical reaction in the brain. This is how immaterial thoughts become matter - through a chemical messenger. Once you begin using words and sounds consciously to generate more of the same brain chemicals, your biology changes, allowing you to remake yourself on the cellular level to begin feeling more oneness and wholeness.
    <br />Name it. So be it, so it is. 
    <br />Words, and their power to affect matter, are the only way to change and upgrade our biology, affecting heart rate variability, with the power to up-regulate genes, reduce survival emotions, heighten immune system, and become more-than-human. 
    <br />
    <br />Words affect matter.
    <br />Naming is an act of creation, stating the existence of what is named into felt reality. This is a practice known for word magic, hekate magic, ancient Greek rhetorics, cross-cultural ritual poetry in all ancient practices, and today by cognitive science, new age wellness methods, backed by neuroscience measuring effect of words on neural circuits. 
    <br />​
    <br />Name it. So be it, so it is. 
    <br />Words affect matter.
    <br />Throughout the day, listen and repeat pleasing words and chants at any time, to affect your biology and enrich brain circuitry. Verbalize only what you wish to experience. 
    <br />​
    <br />Name it. So be it, so it is. 
    <br />Words affect matter.
    <br />Conscious of the sonic territory you exist within, words you read on screens, words spoken to you, or heard through music, you are now conscious of the vibratory sensuous reality, and know that what is named will be experienced. 
    <br />
    <br />Name it. So be it, so it is. 
    <br />Words affect matter.
    <br />Words are used to name things into existence. Words are tools to manipulate reality, changing brain chemistry.
    <br />
    <br />Name it. So be it, so it is. 
    <br />Words affect matter.
    <br />
    <br />I am limitless. 
    <br />
    <br />What’s your name.
    <br />
    <br />I am limitless.

    <br />/// RITUAL INTRODUCTION ////
    <br />////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    <br />​
    <br />(Using rhymes and popular lyrical structures with adlibs, and medical verbal charms such as counting down, repetition, and certain words, on the background of contemporary noise rhythm and sound formulas in Earth's frequency.)
    <br />​
    <br />These words are medicinal
    <br />Making energies be visible
    <br />It’s no miracle or mythical
    <br />But original earth principle
    <br />I am now cosmically invincible
    <br />
    <br />Name it, so be it, so it is.
    <br />
    <br />Words affect matter 
    <br />thoughts affect biology
    <br />Use the words be wise
    <br />To the point you realize
    <br />All thoughts materialize
    <br />
    <br />Word alchemy affect
    <br />My neuro chemistry
    <br />Patterns and lines
    <br />Vibratory charms
    <br />Bring matter to life
    <br />
    <br />Word it, spell it, be it. (10x)
    <br />
    <br />(mhhmmm yeah)
    <br />words you use
    <br />It’s life you choose
    <br />past you close
    <br />The future is open
    <br />Moving slow slow
    <br />Loving down down
    <br />My words bring relief.

    <br />//// NARRATION ////
    <br />///////////////////////////////
    <br />​
    <br />(Instructive narration explains how a verbal spell (counting from 9 to 0) is used to nullify the problems on one's mind. This is also an introduction to the main ritual section of the performance.)
    <br />​
    <br />To reset your mind, count down from 9 to zero. 
    <br />This will nullify the undesired reality.
    <br />Afterwards, name what you desire, about ourselves or the world, into existence. 
    <br />
    <br />​
    <br /> 
    <br />//// RITUAL POETRY ////
    <br />///////////////////////////////////////
    <br />
    <br />(Counting down from 9 until 0, numbers descend from verse to verse - 9 verses in total. Repetitiveness or ritual poetry, allows for immersion of the viewer in the magic spell of the count-down, and affirmations. Using lyrical song structures, bridging the ancient and new sonic patterns in a hybrid conglomerate of meaning.)
    <br />​
    <br />​
    <br />Word it, name it, be it.
    <br />(yeah.)
    <br />In my tired mind - I had 9 problems 
    <br />I could go no - longer - in this lane
    <br />So tired
    <br />I forgot my name now 
    <br />I have lost my name now
    <br />I forgot my name
    <br />Bird calling my name 
    <br />He came to ask my name
    <br />He came to call my name out loud
